# Disclaimer 

I am not a very good coder. I have tried to build a tool, for my own trading purpose.
This tool needs extensive testing before using it and there is no gurantee, that it will work 100%
This code may not be the best code as I am a beginner. You would mostly need some python coding experience, to understand what is happening in the code.

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

# NOTE

This tool is mainly built for option selling.

This tool needs integration with Finvasia API, to function.


# KNOWN ISSUES
