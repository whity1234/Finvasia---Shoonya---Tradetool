# Disclaimer USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
I am not a very good coder. I have tried to build a tool, for my own trading purpose.
This tool needs extensive testing before using it and there is no gurantee, that it will work 100%
This code may not be the best code as I am a beginner. You would mostly need some python coding experience, to understand what is happening in the code.

2. Install other requirements using pip install commands.
3. Update the config.ini for user specific data
